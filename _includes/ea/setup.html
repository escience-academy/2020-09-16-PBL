        The Portal Project Teaching Database is a simplified version of the Portal Project Database designed for teaching.
        It is a tabular dataset of observations of small mammals in a desert ecosystem in Arizona, USA, collected over more than 40 years.
        It provides a real world example of life-history, population, and ecological data, with sufficient complexity to teach many aspects
        of data analysis and management, but with many complexities removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught.
