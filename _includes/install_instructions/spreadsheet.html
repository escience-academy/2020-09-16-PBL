  <h3>Spreadsheet Program</h3>

  <p>
    To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs.
    Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.
    For this lesson, if you don’t have a spreadsheet program already, you can use LibreOffice. It’s a free, open source spreadsheet program.
